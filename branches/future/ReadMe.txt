This is the branch "future" of the XRNX tools. This branch is mirrored into 
the Renoise.exe repository trunk, and thus contains scripts and changes that 
work with Renoise versions that are not yet released.

Branch "future" on XRNX will be synced with the XRNX trunk as soon as new alpha
or beta versions are avilable to people in Renoise.dev.

Please use the XRNX trunk if you are working with the latest public alpha/beta
versions of Renoise. 

PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING HERE, EXCEPT YOU EXACTLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
