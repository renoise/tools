Applications/Navigator
* FIXME When jumping back in pattern, and briefly going to the previous pattern,
 the navigator would break if the previous pattern hadn’t same number of lines

-- Duplex 0.98.22 -----------

Grid Pie
* Overview of new features:
 - Realtime recording (including session recording)
 - Multitouch gestures (assign/resolve aliases, save combination, etc.)
 - Visualization of aliased slots, current track + pattern etc.
 - Configurable initialization and shutdown process (options)
 - Many smaller bug fixes, cleaner code ...
* Feature: assign an alias by pressing and holding a slot button (source), and
  then pressing another button in the same track. The procedure will only
  work when the source slot is already aliased or empty (to avoid accidents)
* Feature: to complement the assignment gesture just mentioned, you can hold
  the button pressed to “force-assign” slots that are empty, or unique
* Feature: resolve any aliased slots in the gridpie pattern to it’s master slot
  by pressing a slot in the gridpie pattern (the last pattern). Conceptually
  similar to the pattern-editor (arrow in the lower part of an aliased track)
* Feature: quickly store “homeless” content (a track in the gridpie pattern with
  no master slot), either by creating a new pattern to hold the data or by
  assigning the content to an existing slot
* Feature: hold a gridpie button to save the combination as a new pattern
* Feature: make an alias unique (un-alias) by holding it, then it’s gridpie slot
* Tweak: highlight the selected alias master slot (if any exists)
* Tweak: better visualization of the current track/sequence position
* New option: “highlight”, toggles track/sequence highlighting on/off
* New option: auto-start has been expanded into “initialization”
* New option: “shutdown”, use it to control the shutdown procedure
* Fixed: de-activating a group track will not send the brief mute (avoid click)
* Fixed: properly update mute state when gridpie is cloned
* Fixed: line notifiers could get lost when scrolling through the song
* Fixed: UI integration with Renoise pattern-matrix is gone (buggy)
* Restructured code, simplified things...


-- Duplex 0.98.21 -----------

TrackSelector
* Fixed: application was updating display when stopped/paused

StepSequencer
* Support line_notifier when slots are aliased (also when created and/or removed)
* Workflow: when navigating from a long pattern into a shorter one, start from 
  the top (IOW, always restrict to the actual pattern length)
* Fixed: update the volume-level display when base volume is changed
* Fixed: selecting a group track could cause an error

Navigator
* Fixed: issue when loading a new song while Navigator was displaying nothing
 (playback happening in a different pattern)

GridPie
* Fixed: retain mute state when toggling a pattern off (hold x2)
* Fixed: track navigation could show wrong track on startup
* Feature: turbocharged mode (using a pattern cache along with aliased slots)
* Feature/workflow: (even) closer integration into Renoise
 - detect changes to mute states in the Renoise matrix (mouse+alt-click)
 - detect when a pattern has been scheduled in Renoise
 - disable pattern loop to allow song to play, pattern-by-pattern (1)
* Feature/workflow: ability to clone gridpie pattern while playing

  (1) This, and pattern scheduling via Renoise can be considered experimental as 
  we can’t reliably detect a scheduled pattern. As a result, the first few 
  note(s) might be skipped!

Duplex Core
* Fixed: bug when handling MIDI ports that are added/removed while running
* Streamlined documentation with lua-doc friendly code formatting


-- Duplex 0.98.20 -----------

GridPie
* Edit-sync: automatic background-synchronization of pattern data
* Edit-sync: detect changes to the pattern length (source tracks)
* Update grid display as content is created or removed in the matrix
* Visualize the currently selected pattern (when the controller is able to)
* Attempt to maintain pattern matrix slot mute states at all times (1)
* Ability to clone the __GRID PIE__ pattern without stopping the application
* New option: Beat-measures (related to the improved ‘keep the beat’ feature)
* Fixed: removed display-glitch in the virtual UI (on startup)
* Fixed: remove all notifiers when app is stopped

PatternSequence
* New application: simple sequence navigation (first/next/previous/last)

StepSequencer
* Fixed: focus bug when holding button

(1) GridPie will attempt to retain as much information about the mute state of 
the song as possible, as this is restored when we exit GridPie. Note however 
that using drag-and-drop within the pattern sequence will cause the mute state 
to become lost for the rearranged patterns. Simple insert/clone and delete 
actions should not cause this to happen.


-- Duplex 0.98.19 -----------

Duplex core API
* Display: removed some checks before updating hardware display

Effect application
* Fixed: device-navigator now works after switching song/document

Monome XYPad control-map
* Fixed, corrected tilt-sensors to use floating-point values - was incorrectly 
  labelled as integers

Monome XYPad config
* Fixed incorrect placement of “focus button”, improved layout

Launchpad Effect config
* TrackSelector now using full width (8) as the default page-size

XYPad application
* Simplified setup: use unique, automatically-generated names to identify 
  “managed” XYPads (no more need for manually specified id’s)

-- Duplex 0.98.18 -----------

Duplex core API
* Applications: all palettes standardized
* For devices with mixed colorspaces (APC20/40), prefer “tinting” over “theming”
* Fixed error when using #CC buttons on a virtual display as keyboard keys (the 
  issue affected AKAI LPD8)
* OSC buffering: all but float-based arguments are now buffered

StepSequencer
* Mappings track, level, line, transpose are now optional. This should fix an 
  issue with the nano2K config that didn’t specify ‘track’
* Fixed: under certain conditions, could throw error on startup

Grid Pie
* Disable of “follow_player” now only enforced outside the grid-pie pattern

Recorder
* Fixed: under certain conditions, could throw error on startup

Launchpad/Matrix config
* Made “control loop+position” the default option


-- Duplex 0.98.17 -----------

* Fixme: Metronome: wrong placement on launchpad? #5 lights up #7 ??
* Refactor: UIButton (replaces UIPushButton, UIToggleButton, UIStepSeqButton)
* UIComponent event handlers should always return “false” when actively 
  rejecting an event (such as when the application is sleeping/inactive), 
  allowing the MIDI message to be passed on to Renoise
* Virtual control surface able to display text & color simultaneously
* Theming support: specify the default button color (default is white). No UI is 
  provided for changing the value, so in order to match Duplex with your own 
  theme color, modify the value in Globals.lua (search for “theme”) and delete 
  your preferences before restarting.

SwitchConfiguration
* Light up arrow only if next/previous config is available

Transport
* Stop scheduled blinking when current pattern is re-scheduled

Mixer
* remove “invert” option in favor of customizable palette

GridPie
* fixed a bug in the “running start” feature (when switching away from Grid 
  without having run the application)

-- Duplex 0.98.16 -----------

Duplex core API
* Fixme: stuck notes when transposing into unhandled range
* Fixme: stuck notes when transposing into handled range
  Solution: make the voice-manager support passed messages (differentiating 
  between handled OSC notes and unhandled MIDI notes - detecting the active 
  track & instruments for MIDI notes the moment they’re triggered)
* Fixme: UIPushButton double-fires press in virtual control surface

Keyboard
* Display message on how to enable OSC server (first time only)

Grid Pie
* Features: “Keep the beat” and “running start”

Config: APC
* Add sato’s extended configurations

* MIDI pass-on: all UIComponents can “actively reject” an event
* Control-map: MIDI channel support for keyboards (specific/any channel)
* Control-map: pitch-bend mappings receive + send
* New class: OscVoiceMgr, provides voice-management features
* Device-config: hide specific application options (hidden_options)
* Fixed: choosing “cancel” when shutting down devices would throw an error
* Fixed: proper access to document nodes (.value)
-- Applications/XYPad.lua --
* Fixed: No longer looses focus when navigating to a new track
-- Applications/Keyboard.lua --
* New option: “Keyboard Mode”, choose which notes (if any) to trigger

 o Feature is disabled per default, enable in Duplex menu)
* Restructured device folders, auto-include configs when Duplex is started
* Customizable palette for each application configuration
 o Will import specified values on top of default palette
 o See e.g. Launchpad XYPad configuration for an example
* Automation class, for recording movements into automation envelopes
 o Touch and latch recording (latch is considered experimental)
* New class: OscClient, a shared connection for sending internally routed 
  messages (simple interface, accessible to all applications)
* New class: OscVoiceMgr, for keeping the currently triggered notes in order 
  (avoid stuck notes, problems with release). Requires OscClient.
* New class: UIKey, a UIComponent designed to receive and represent note 
  information (pitch & velocity). UIKeys can either be linked to individual 
  keys, or process all incoming note messages from a keyboard (see Keyboard).
* New class: UIKeyPressure (UISlider), for receiving a continuous stream of 
  velocity information from a keyboard
* New class: UIPitchBend (UISlider), will enable an application to receive 
  pitch-bend information from a keyboard
* New class: UIPad (UIComponent), implemented as paired axes (for OSC) or 
  independent X/Y axis (for MIDI devices)
* ControlMap: New input method “xypad”, for creating XYPad controls in the 
  virtual control surface (paired-value support, however only OSC devices can 
  define this input method)
* Control-map, new input method: “key” - for accepting note-input from 
  individual buttons/pads
* Control-map/virtual control surface: “keyboard” - a new input method for 
  representing a keyboard (the control surface will draw a series of keys)
 o In the control-map, you can specify it’s range (number of keys)
* Control-map/XML parsing:
 o Attribute names can now contain underscore
* Control-map/note value syntax: octave wildcard - you can now put an asterisk 
  in place of the octave to make mapping respond to the note only (e.g. “C-*”). 
  Used in the Midi-keyboard Grid Pie configuration to make navigation buttons 
  appear across all the black keys

Duplex browser/menu
* Tool menu: devices organized into sub-menu’s
* Tool menu: display on startup (only when active config)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Done 0.91
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fixed: Transport: always turn off "start" when hitting "stop"

* Matrix: all mappings are now without dependancies (no more "required" groups)

* Application:add_component() automatically unregister components when exiting 
  o Existing apps updated to support the new method, destroy_app() removed.

* Fixed: Effect: check if "no device" is selected (initial state)

* Specify color-space as <Group> attribute in the control-map 
  o Support for devices like APC, where not all buttons are the same
  o Colorspace is still specified via the device class, but a colorspace defined 
    in the control-map will override the device colorspace

* Specify MIDI channel mapping as an extension to the <Param> value attribute
  o Simple syntax : "CC#23|2" to match channel #2
  o Optional: if undefined, simply match all channels
  o Affects all messages that support channels (CC,Notes,etc.)

* Seperate notifiers for press/release on the virtual control surface 
  o Now, it's possible to support "held" buttons events


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Done 0.92
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Transport
  o New option: "stop playback" when pressing play while playing
  o Re-arranged Launchpad configuration (uses the new option)

* UITriggerButton
  o Added release event, and "wait_for_release" mode (a.k.a. sustain)

* UIBasicButton + StepSequencer
  o Added Daxton's code to the distribution (with some small modifications)

* Assign tooltips to the control surface that describe the *actual* purpose 
  o This could largely replace the need for app documentation?

  o Effect has contextual tooltip support: show name of DSP parameter
  o The remaining apps have "basic" tooltip support

* Replace the mapping property "required" (not used) with "greedy"
* Add "ui_component" to mappings, to describe the type of UIComponent
  o for the planned visual mapping dialog, this will be needed
  o also helpful when browsing application class code


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Done 0.93
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* UIButtonStrip, for controlling/displaying a sequence
  o Can control position and range simultaneously (Matrix sequence triggers)
  o Optimized for monochrome devices

* UISpinner improvements (better togglebutton support)
  o TouchOSC and other controllers using togglebutton input should now 
    display the UISpinner correctly at all times...

* Browser: 
  o Switch between device presets/configurations using function keys
  o Forward keypresses to Renoise (except those we use for switching)

* Application: 
  o Application.options[].on_activate(): specify a method to be executed 
    immediately before the application is started - for example, to provide a
    UIComponent with values *after* it has been constructed

* Matrix:
  o Updated to support interactive pattern looping (via UIButtonStrip)
  o Utilize "blinking" feature to display a scheduled pattern
  o "follow_player" mode in Renoise will now update the matrix immediately

* StepSequencer:
  o Display playposition and volume simultaneously (via UIButtonStrip)
  o Better support for other/monochrome devices (Monome)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Done 0.95
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* New devices/control-maps: Monome64 + AKAI LPD8/MPD24/MPD24

* Recorder (looping recorder)
  o Beta version, still need a way to start recording immediately (09xx)

* Navigator (position control)
  o Interactively control the blockloop position and size

* Controlmap
  o New button type: pushbutton (like togglebutton, has internal state control)
    - UISlider, UIToggleButton made compatible with pushbutton (special case)
    - We can now emulate sliders on the TouchOSC template (page 2)
    - Nocturn and Remote will now be able to support hold/release events
  o "name" attribute now optional (excluded from validation)
  o "size" attribute now also applied to dials (see MPD24/32)
  o Streamlined methods for detecting group size, grid mode

* Updated automap configurations for Novation Remote/Nocturn
  o Updated to make use of "pushbutton" (release & hold events for buttons)

* StepSequencer
  o Option: switch orientation (vertical or horizontal)
  o Option: use variable "increment" value instead of being fixed to #lines
    - this works better with "strange" number of steps like 15
  o Monitor changes to pattern (the part being displayed), keep grid in sync
    - uses the new line notifiers added in RC2
  o Display "out-of-bounds" space in the same way as the Matrix 
  o Enabling Renoise's follow mode will cause instant catch-up
  o Output status messages when basenote/volume is modified
  o Better performance (idle lag patch)

* Effect
  o Now supports grid controllers
    - Limit meta-device routings to 7-bit (avoid skipping every 2nd value)
    - Updated configurations for Launchpad, monome
  o Seperated device-navigator group size from parameter group size
  o Use standard (customizable) palette instead of hard-coded values
  o Set focus to TrackVolPan device when no device is selected
  o Applied feedback fix, additional check for invalid meta-device values

* Mixer
  o Hold mute button to toggle solo state for the given track
  o Applied feedback fix (cascading mutes when solo'ing)

* Browser/Device: 
  o Refactoring: moved the "settings" dialog into the Browser class, as the
    dialog will eventually contain application settings etc. The device now 
    only contains the device-specific UI code, and not the dialog itself
    
* UIComponent/Canvas
  o When a UIComponent is resized, invalidate it
  o When a UIComponent is resized to a smaller size, remove canvas-points by
    using an additional "clear" buffer from the Canvas class. The "clear" buffer 
    is then applied during the next Display refresh

* UISlider
  o set_orientation(): generic method for getting/setting orientation
  o "steps" property (properly quantize a dial/fader, instead of using size)

* UIButtonStrip
  o Set point values when drawing control (forgot this in 0.93)
  o Added "steps" property (control a range less than the control's size)

* Application 
  o More safe-guards when launching application (start_app)
    - check if application mappings exist in control-map
    - application build_app() methods can halt execution if criteria isn't met

* Globals/etc.
  o is_monochrome() will now also work with devices that have no colorspace 
  o Double underscored property names (__) replaced with single underscore (_)
    to avoid accidental clashes with lua's internal meta-method names

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Done 0.96
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Duplex Browser
  o Interactively change options while applications are running
    - Application:_apply_options() and optional on_activate() has been removed
  o Fixed: hot-plugging devices caused an error (bug was introduced in 0.95)
  o More MIDI-mapping options: set,select previous/next configuration

* Control-map
  o New attribute: "aspect", control height of button (0.5 for 50% height)
