  <!-- This is the renoise.API_VERSION your tool relies on. Any changes in -->
  <!-- the API which are not fully backwards compatible, will increase the internal -->
  <!-- APIs major version number (i.e from 1.4 -> 2.0). All other backwards compatible -->
  <!-- changes, like new functionality, new functions and classes will increase only  --> 
  <!-- the minor version number (i.g: 1.0 -> 1.1).  -->
  <!-- This means that you tools major API version always MUST match the internal major --> 
  <!-- Api version in order to run. But this also gurantees that small additions and --> 
  <!-- changes to the internal API will not break existing tools. -->
